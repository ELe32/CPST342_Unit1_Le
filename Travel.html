    Phu Quoc is an island known for fish sauce manufacturing in the early age, but it has recently become the hottest<br>
    travel attraction. Phu Quoc travel rate increases by 25% from the prior year.  A short flight from Saigon will get<br>
    you there to enjoy scenic beaches and great seafood. Not only will you be amazed by the natural attractions, you <br>
    will soon discover many great seafood restaurants.<br>

    I came back to visit a few years ago and I hardly recognize all my childhood landmarks as many high-end hotels <br>
    and restaurants rose up from every corner. Seeing with my own eyes how an old fishermen village transformed into <br>
    a Vietnam main attraction was priceless. I truly believe Phu Quoc has some of the most beautiful beaches in the world.<br>
